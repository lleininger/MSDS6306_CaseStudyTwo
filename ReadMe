Case Study 2 Codebook


Study Design:

We used two data sets containing explanatory variables and attrition data divided into a training and validation set. We used R and Excel to graphically and quantitatively determine which explanatory variables were most significant in determining an employee's departure, as well as to remove potential issues with multicollinearity. We then used those remaining variables to build a KNN model to predict Attrition. Our model yielded 88.7% accuracy with a 95% confidence interval of (84.5%, 92.0%) accuracy.


Objects:

dfTrain: testing data

dfVal: testing(validation data)

eda2: dfTrain with dummy columns

eda_test2: testing (validation) data with dummy columns

Extra_Train: adds explanatory variables not otherwise covered by dummy columns (i.e. manually creates another dataframe of dummy variables)

Training_Indicator: dataframe of training indicators used in knn predictive model

Training_Class: dataframe of attrition = yes values for training data

Extra_Test: adds explanatory variables not otherwise covered by dummy columns (i.e. manually creates another dataframe of dummy variables)

Validation_Indicators: dataframe of test indicators used in knn predictive model

Validation_Class: appends dfVal with dummy columns

Validation: dataframe of attrition = yes values for test data

p: stores predictions of knn function on Validation_Indicators using Training_Indicator and Training_Class data

cf: retrieves a confusion matrix on the predictions in p and the validation data

accuracies: dataframe of accuracies stored in the ith iteration

accuracy_check: stores current ith accuracy

most_accurate: holds most accurate iteration accuracy value

mode_accurate_pred: holds preductions for most accurate iteration

Predictions: holds preductions for most accurate iteration

dfPreds: Translates and stores attrition values for csv write
